1.We can change the datafolder path in /configs/small/underwater/simsiam_ccrop_pretrain.py.
2.We can tranfer the weight with SSLMarineOrgnismDET/self-weight_converter.py, using this file can make the SSLMarineOrgnismDET weight file transfer to downstream mmdetection.
3.The downstream task is mmdetection
4.When we tranferred the pretext weight to downstream weight file, we can change in SSLMarineOrgnismDET/mmdetection/configs/_base_/models/xxx.py to change the checkpoint file.
